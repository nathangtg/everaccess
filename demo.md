# EverAccess Investor Demo Script (30s - 60s)

**Goal:** Demonstrate how EverAccess solves the "digital inheritance" problem by making it easy to secure assets now and simple for loved ones to claim them later.

## 🛠️ Pre-Demo Setup
*Ensure these exist in your database before recording/presenting:*
1.  **Log in** to the dashboard.
2.  **Create 2 Beneficiaries** (e.g., "Alice (Spouse)" and "Bob (Brother)") so you don't have to type them in during the demo.
3.  **Have a "Dummy" file** ready on your desktop named `death_certificate.pdf` (or similar) for the upload step.

## 🎬 The Script

### 1. The "Peace of Mind" Setup (0:00 - 0:25)
*Start on the **Dashboard**.*

**Action:** Click **"Crypto Assets"** -> Click on an existing Asset (or "New").
**Narrative:** "We all own digital assets, but what happens to them when we're gone? EverAccess solves this. Here, I'm securing my Bitcoin wallet."

**Action:** Scroll to the **Allocation** section (The Pie/Donut Chart).
**Action:** Add an allocation: Select "Alice", type "50%". Select "Bob", type "50%". Click **Save**.
**Narrative:** "I don't need a lawyer. I just select my beneficiaries—my wife and brother—and split the access rights instantly. It's legally compliant and cryptographically secure."

### 2. The Trigger Event (0:25 - 0:40)
*Navigate to the **Inheritance Claim** page (or switch browser tabs to represent the 'Beneficiary' view).*

**Action:** Show the simple **"File a Claim"** form.
**Action:** Upload the `death_certificate.pdf`. Click **Submit**.
**Narrative:** "When the unthinkable happens, my beneficiaries don't face complex bureaucracy. They simply file a claim through our secure portal, which triggers our verification protocol."

### 3. The Close (0:40 - 0:50)
*Switch back to **Dashboard** or a "Verified" status view.*

**Action:** Show a "Pending Verification" or "Secure" status.
**Narrative:** "Once verified, access keys are automatically decrypted and released to the right people, ensuring my digital legacy is never lost. This is EverAccess."
