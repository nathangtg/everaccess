MVP Scope: Core Features + Crypto Asset Distribution
1. User Management & Authentication (Simplified)

Email/password registration and login
Basic session management (JWT tokens, 24-hour expiry)
Role-based access:

Account Owner (regular user)
Beneficiary (limited access)
Admin (verification reviewer)


Simple password reset via email token
MFA - defer to production

2. Asset Storage & Management
Priority Assets:

Login Credentials: username, password, URL, notes
Crypto Wallets (MOCK):

Wallet type (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
Wallet address (mock)
Private key/seed phrase (encrypted, mock data)
Balance (mock amount in USD)
Percentage allocation to beneficiaries


Basic Documents: PDF/image upload for important files

Features:

Simple categorization (Crypto, Passwords, Documents)
Basic metadata (name, type, date added, notes)
File upload with 10MB limit per file

3. Crypto Distribution Logic (Mock Implementation)

Asset allocation interface:

Assign percentages to beneficiaries per crypto asset
Visual percentage calculator (must total 100%)
Validation: ensure allocations don't exceed 100%


Mock disbursement simulation:

Calculate distribution amounts based on percentages
Generate mock "transaction IDs"
Display distribution summary to beneficiaries
Status tracking (pending → approved → disbursed)



Example Flow:
User has 1.5 BTC ($60,000)
- Beneficiary A: 60% = 0.9 BTC ($36,000)
- Beneficiary B: 40% = 0.6 BTC ($24,000)
4. Data Security & Encryption (Basic)

Application-level encryption for sensitive fields:

Passwords
Crypto private keys/seeds
Personal notes


Use Python's cryptography library with Fernet (symmetric encryption)
Encryption key stored in environment variables (per-user keys later)
HTTPS/TLS for local dev (self-signed cert)
Password hashing with bcrypt

5. Beneficiary Management

Add beneficiaries: name, email, relationship
Assign asset access rules:

Select specific assets OR all assets
Define crypto allocation percentages


Beneficiary notification (email when added)
Simple list view with edit/remove capabilities

6. Verification & Trigger Mechanism (Manual)
Beneficiary Request Flow:

Beneficiary receives notification of their designation
When needed, beneficiary uploads:

Death certificate (PDF/image)
Government ID
Relationship proof (optional)


Admin reviews in admin panel
Admin approves/rejects with notes
Upon approval, beneficiary gets time-limited access (7 days)

Admin Tools:

Verification queue dashboard
Document viewer
Approve/reject buttons with reason field
Email notifications on decision

7. Beneficiary Portal
Post-Verification Access:

Separate login for beneficiaries
View assigned assets (passwords revealed, crypto details)
Crypto distribution summary:

Allocated amount and percentage
Mock wallet address to receive funds
"Disbursement status" indicator
Mock transaction ID once "disbursed"


Download documents
View messages from deceased (optional)
Access expires after 7 days (configurable)

8. Payment Integration (Simplified)

Stripe test mode for $1/month subscription
Basic subscription status (active/expired)
Manual payment link (no auto-renewal for prototype)
Partner licensing - defer
Invoice generation - defer

9. User Interface (Minimal Viable)
Account Owner Dashboard:

Asset summary cards (total count by type)
Quick add asset button
Beneficiary list with status
Profile settings

Asset Management:

List view with filters (Crypto, Passwords, Documents)
Add/Edit forms with crypto allocation interface
Delete with confirmation

Crypto Allocation Interface:

Drag sliders or input fields for percentages
Real-time calculation display
Visual progress bars showing allocations
Validation warnings if total ≠ 100%

Beneficiary Dashboard:

Assets grid view
Crypto distribution breakdown
Download buttons
Access timer (days remaining)

Admin Panel:

Verification queue table
User management
System statistics

10. Database (Local PostgreSQL)
Essential Tables:

users
beneficiaries
assets
crypto_assets (extends assets)
crypto_allocations
access_rules
verification_requests
verification_documents
access_logs
payments (basic)

11. Email Notifications (Local Testing)
Use Mailhog or similar for local email testing:

Beneficiary designation notification
Verification request submitted
Verification approved/rejected
Access expiring soon (2 days before)
Subscription expiring

12. Infrastructure (Local Development)

Docker Compose setup:

FastAPI backend
Next.js frontend
PostgreSQL database
Redis (for sessions/caching)
Mailhog (email testing)
MinIO (S3-compatible storage for files)




Deferred to Production

Real crypto wallet integration
MFA/2FA
Advanced encryption (per-user keys, key rotation)
Partner licensing
Advanced analytics
Automated document verification (OCR/AI)
Real payment gateway with webhooks
CDN for file delivery
Compliance certifications
Advanced audit logging


Mock Crypto Implementation Details
Crypto Asset Schema Addition:
pythoncrypto_assets
- crypto_asset_id (PK, FK -> assets.asset_id)
- wallet_type (ENUM: bitcoin, ethereum, usdt, etc.)
- wallet_address (VARCHAR, mock)
- private_key (ENCRYPTED, mock)
- seed_phrase (ENCRYPTED, mock)
- balance_usd (DECIMAL) - mock amount
- balance_crypto (DECIMAL) - mock amount
- last_updated (TIMESTAMP)
Crypto Allocation Schema:
pythoncrypto_allocations
- allocation_id (PK, UUID)
- crypto_asset_id (FK -> crypto_assets.crypto_asset_id)
- beneficiary_id (FK -> beneficiaries.beneficiary_id)
- percentage (DECIMAL) - must sum to 100 per asset
- allocated_amount_usd (DECIMAL) - calculated
- allocated_amount_crypto (DECIMAL) - calculated
- disbursement_status (ENUM: pending, approved, disbursed)
- mock_transaction_id (VARCHAR)
- disbursed_at (TIMESTAMP)
Mock Disbursement Logic:
pythondef calculate_crypto_distribution(crypto_asset_id):
    """Calculate and generate mock disbursements"""
    asset = get_crypto_asset(crypto_asset_id)
    allocations = get_allocations(crypto_asset_id)
    
    for allocation in allocations:
        allocation.allocated_amount_usd = asset.balance_usd * (allocation.percentage / 100)
        allocation.allocated_amount_crypto = asset.balance_crypto * (allocation.percentage / 100)
        allocation.mock_transaction_id = f"MOCK-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:16]}"
        allocation.disbursement_status = "disbursed"
        allocation.disbursed_at = datetime.now()
    
    return allocations
